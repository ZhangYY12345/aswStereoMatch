# aswStereoMatch
local stereo match based on adaptive support weight

research on the weight computation in asw
1.bilateral filter based asw, the traditional asw, and the time complexity is quite high
2.asw based on approximate bilateral filter,apply the accelerate algorithms on bilateral filter to asw in stereo matching
  2.1 BLGride based asw
  2.2 BLO(1) based asw
3.geodesic distance based asw
4.guided filter based asw
5.weighted median based asw

This project is following the work of paper published in 2013:
      Secrets of adaptive support weight techniques for local stereo matching
you can refer to the paper for detail reading and further research.
